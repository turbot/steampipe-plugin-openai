| Item        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credentials | OpenAI requires an [API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) for all requests.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Permissions | API Keys have the same permissions as the user who creates them, and if the user permissions change, the API key permissions also change.                                                                                                                                               |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single OpenAI Installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/openai.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest openai plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/openai.spc`) with a single connection named `openai`:

```hcl
connection "openai" {
  plugin = "openai"

  # Get your API key at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
  # This can also be set via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  api_key = "sk-CGG8G29a47ViRhvVsCGPT8BlbkFJBvFr65mZcMJWH8fay..."
}
```

### Credentials from Environment Variables

The OpenAI plugin will use the standard OpenAI environment variables to obtain credentials **only if other arguments (`api_key`) are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-CGG8G29a47ViRhvVsCGPT8BlbkFJBvFr65mZcMJWH8fayZO8
```
